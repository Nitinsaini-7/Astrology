      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Aries (March 21 - April 19)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This week, Aries, you’ll feel a burst of energy thanks to the Sun in Virgo forming a harmonious trine with Uranus in Taurus. Use this dynamic energy to bring innovative ideas to life, especially in your work and finances. However, midweek, a challenging aspect between Mars and Neptune may cloud your judgment in personal matters. Stay grounded and avoid making impulsive decisions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For Taurus, the focus is on relationships and communication. The Sun and Mercury highlight your house of love and partnerships, pushing you to resolve lingering issues. Be open to honest discussions. Over the weekend, the Moon in Capricorn brings a practical approach to your emotional life, allowing you to set clearer boundaries.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Expect a week of productivity, Gemini! With Mercury still in Virgo, your ruling planet, your analytical skills will be sharp. It's a great time to tackle detailed projects and refine your daily routines. Towards the end of the week, Venus in Leo encourages you to add some creativity and self-expression into your personal life.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cancer, emotions are heightened as the Moon moves through your fellow water sign Scorpio. You're encouraged to delve deep into self-reflection. Midweek, you may feel tension between your personal desires and professional responsibilities. Don’t shy away from asking for help when you need it.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Leo (July 23 - August 22)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Leo, the Sun’s ongoing journey through Virgo is asking you to focus on practical matters. Financial planning and health are key themes this week.

This weekend, focus on inner peace and aligning your intentions for the future.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Scorpio (October 23 - November 21)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This week, Scorpio, you might feel called to address unresolved emotions, especially as the Moon passes through your sign.

      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Aquarius (January 20 - February 18)</h2>

      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Pisces (February 19 - March 20)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Pisces, you may feel a pull between your dreams and reality as Mars opposes Neptune in your sign. This can stir up feelings of confusion, but also inspiration. Ground yourself through creative projects and spiritual practices. By the weekend, the Moon in Capricorn will help you make sense of your emotions and take practical steps forward.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
